# Azure End-to-End Data-Engineer-Project

This project is a comprehensive data engineering pipeline solution built to tackle a simulated business problem. It was designed to deepen my understanding of cloud-based data pipelining and to provide hands-on experience with Azure data services.

## Project Overview

This project addresses a critical business need by building a comprehensive data pipeline on Azure using the Adventure Works dataset. The dataset, sourced from a GitHub repository, provides detailed insights into customer demographics, sales transactions, and product inventories. The objective is to simulate a real-world scenario by extracting data from this external source, transforming it within the cloud environment, and loading it into a centralized data warehouse. The processed data then feeds into an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs), such as sales trends, product performance, and customer segmentation. Stakeholders can filter and analyze the data by date, product category, and geographic regions, empowering data-driven decision-making and showcasing best practices in cloud-based data engineering.

## Business Requirement

#### Data Integration:
The solution must extract data from an external GitHub repository hosting the Adventure Works dataset, ensuring a reliable and automated data import process.

#### Data Transformation and Cleansing:
Raw data should be transformed and cleansed in Azure to standardize formats, remove inconsistencies, and enrich data quality for analysis.

#### Centralized Data Storage:
The processed data must be loaded into a centralized data warehouse or database in Azure, providing a single source of truth for all subsequent analyses.

##### Interactive Reporting and Visualization:
A dynamic Power BI dashboard should be developed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales trends, product category performance, and customer segmentation. The dashboard must enable users to filter and drill down into data by dimensions such as date, product category, and geographic region.

#### Actionable Insights:
The system must provide actionable insights that support strategic business decision-making, including identifying sales opportunities, detecting trends, and evaluating the impact of marketing initiatives.

#### Scalability and Performance:
The data pipeline and associated reporting tools must be designed to handle increasing volumes of data over time, ensuring performance remains robust as business needs evolve.

#### Security and Compliance:
All data handling processes should adhere to enterprise security standards and compliance requirements to protect sensitive business information.

## Solution Overview

To meet these requirements, the solution is broken down into the following components:

#### Data Ingestion:
Extract customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database.\
Load the raw data into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) using Azure Data Factory (ADF).
Data Transformation:

#### Use Azure Databricks to clean and transform the data.
Organize the data into Bronze (raw), Silver (cleansed), and Gold (aggregated) layers.

#### Data Loading and Reporting:

Load the transformed Silver data into Azure Synapse Analytics for detailed processing.\
Upload the Gold data using an external table in Azure Synapse Analytics, enabling efficient querying and reporting.\
Build a dynamic Power BI dashboard to visualize the data, providing stakeholders with insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and more.

#### Automation:
Schedule the entire pipeline to run daily, ensuring that both the data and reports are always up-to-date.
